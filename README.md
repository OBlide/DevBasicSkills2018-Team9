# DevBasicSkills2018-Team9
Project Math

This was a project work that finished our second course of the autumn of 2018. 
It brought all the subtopics together to show our knowledge.

Our task was to design and implement a web page with mathematics tools.
These tools are: number converter, number system, combinatorics calculator, truth table, random value generator and a number checker
which is an optional function.
